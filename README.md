# FTS
## Description

A home nodeJs server which allows you to backup and transfer files between devices.
The program is run with Node Js and uses many libraries.
The goal of this project is to simply learn Node Js and create a simple way to transfer and backup files in my house, and possibly from anywhere in the future.

## Devices

The program has both a mobile and web view. There is no native app yet but I am looking to possibly create one in the future.

So far this is only my first version. I started the project to learn about Node Js and it worked and I plan to continue to work on this in the future.
